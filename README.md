this game is implemented in cpp using trie tree data structure

Abstract:
 Scrable Game: A word game
Auto-Suggest : Suggests the words
Trie Implementation of words and meaning

I have used Trie data structure (also known as Prefix tree). Because this data structure efficiently
Works with words and reduce the time complexity on run time. This Project contains a game named
Scrable which is a word game ,in this game there are rounds selection as many as a player want and
also it suggests the word to the player its one on one game played by two players at a time.
Introduction:
I have developed an scrable game using trie. As we have seen in our daily life that
we are often playing word games on daily bases. So, from our daily
observation we can simply conclude that the most important and commonly used feature of
any game is players score and how many rounds they have played and thats all are implemented
in this game.
To program dictionary using Tree was also good option but it gave us time complexity of
m*log(n) which is way more complex .
So, we used Trie data Structure which made our game even faster by reducing time
complexity to just O(m).

After our Implementation:
Searching: The time efficiency of searching increased to just the size of strings.
Insertion: same goes for insertion its time efficiency also increased to just the size strings.
Implementation:
Data Structure Used
Trie Utility Data Structure Used
Strings
Dynamic Memory

Reason Behind Using Trie:
Trie is a n tree which reduces the time complexity and makes program run faster.i
Have used trie because on backend there was a need of trie to search the words from our data
easily that can work faster so we implemented trie algorithm which helps me a lot throughout the game to work efficiently.

Algorithms Used:
Trie Algorithm

Results:
1. scrabble:
It costs the complexity of O(m)
2. Search:
Searching is in O (m) where m is the size of string/word. As compared
to BST implementation of Tree it is much more efficient.|
Conclusion:
Since it is one of the implementation of data structure, we can implement a word game using
different algorithms and data structures. We have improved time complexity of Searching by
using Trie data structure . Also this is a user friendly game which works more efficiently as compared
to normal scrabble word games
